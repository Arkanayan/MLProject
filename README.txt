Source code files of Regression Analysis.

./datasets directory contains the datasets.

Algorithm named files (e.g. de.m, FWA.m) files contains the implementations of the algorithms.

"runAndReport::Algorithm name::.m" files runs algorithms with cross validations and writes to excel file.

"run::Algorithm name::.m" files runs algorithms against the datasets. 

"results.xlsx" file stores the results.
